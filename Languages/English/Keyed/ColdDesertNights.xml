  <ColdDesertNights_Function>{0} Function</ColdDesertNights_Function>
  <ColdDesertNights_Function_Desc>The temperature function for this biome; the flatter you go, the more sharply temperature drops off at night and rises during the day, but the more CPU intensive the calculation is.</ColdDesertNights_Function_Desc>
  <ColdDesertNights_Multiplier>{0} Day-Night Difference</ColdDesertNights_Multiplier>
  <ColdDesertNights_Multiplier_Desc>The degrees Celsius that the temperature will drop between the hottest point in the day and the coldest point in the night (default 14).</ColdDesertNights_Multiplier_Desc>
  <ColdDesertNights_Offset>{0} Offset</ColdDesertNights_Offset>
  <ColdDesertNights_Offset_Desc>The Celsius temperature offset for this biome (default 0).  At 0, this will produce days which are just as hot as vanilla, but adjust nights down by the difference set above.  Positive values will produce warmer days and nights, while negative values will produce colder days and nights.</ColdDesertNights_Offset_Desc>
